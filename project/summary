Project: gift-advisor (divine-violet + bold-lake)

What this repo contains (important files)
- worker/arsenal-worker-toggle.mjs  — divine-violet worker with env.USE_FALLBACK toggle, D1 storage & paging.
- worker/bold-lake-worker.js       — bold-lake worker that loads catalog.json, scores items, and returns recommendations.
- generate-catalog.js             — Node script to generate N realistic catalog entries (writes catalog.json).
- catalog.json                    — generated product catalog (if you ran the generator).
- worker/bold-lake-expand-items.mjs — optional snippet to synthesize variants when catalog is small.

How to resume with me (single command I will ask for first)
- From your project folder run:
  git remote -v
  Paste the full output into the chat when you return.

If you prefer to share a URL instead:
- Paste your repository URL (e.g. https://github.com/your-username/your-repo) or the public catalog.json URL:
  https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/catalog.json

Key facts to remember (from our session)
- MAX_ARSENAL = 1000 in divine-violet; PAGE_SIZE = 50.
- bold-lake currently loads catalog.json and returned 26 items (catalog had ~26 matches).
- We created a node generator to produce 300/500/1000 items: generate-catalog.js
- Recommended long-term: fill catalog.json with real items and host via GitHub Pages.
- Quick/fallback: expand items with expandItemsTo() that synthesizes variants.

Immediate next steps I can do for you when you return
- If you push the repo / catalog.json: I will give the single one-line change to bold-lake CATALOG_URL (if needed) and a single test POST to confirm bold-lake returns N items.
- If you prefer the quick patch: I will produce a single-file worker replacement that integrates expandItemsTo and returns synthesized variants when catalog is small.

Security & privacy notes
- Keep any API keys, secrets, or credentials out of the repo (use environment variables in workers).
- If you want me to edit files in the repo, paste the file(s) or grant access via a tool you control — I cannot access your account on my own.

If you want, I can also:
- produce a one-line git commit you can run now to add this PROJECT_SUMMARY.md to your repo, or
- produce a backup zip you can download and store locally.

When you return, paste the git remote -v output (or the repo URL) and say “resume” — I’ll pick up exactly where we left off and give the next single action.
